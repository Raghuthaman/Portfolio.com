		<p>My hobby is playing chess in my free time. Whenever I finish my classes I like to play chess in online websites. After I finish the game I will analyze the game and I will find out the mistakes I have made and also by my opponent in the game. I will watch games played by Grandmasters, in Youtube. Whenever I am free I will play chess with my father. Playing chess will be interesting and I enjoy the game.

	<p>Wilhelm Steinitz, (born May 14, 1836, Prague, Bohemia, Austrian Empire [now in Czech Republic]—died August 12, 1900, Wards Island, New York, U.S.), Austrian-American chess master who is considered to have been the world champion longer than any other player, winning the championship in 1866 from Adolf Anderssen (although the first official claim to hold the title was not made until 1886) and losing it in 1894 to Emanuel Lasker.Steinitz learned to play chess from a schoolmate when he was about 12 years old. In 1858 he entered the Polytechnic Institute in Vienna, but he soon dropped out of school and occupied himself with chess full-time. In 1862 he represented Austria in his first national tournament. Later that year he moved to England, and in 1883 he moved to the United States, where he was finally defeated by Lasker.</p> <br><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Wilhelm+steinitz&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjRoMucj4DyAhXVNnIKHRzqAvsQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=Wilhelm+steinitz&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIECCMQJzICCAAyAggAMgQIABAeMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYMgQIABAYUMYTWMYTYPocaABwAHgAgAGLAYgBiwGSAQMwLjGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=j1f-YJGdJNXtyAOc1IvYDw&bih=852&biw=1745" target="_blank">Click here to view pictures of Wilhelm Steinitz</a>

		<p>Galileo di Vincenzo Bonaiuti de' Galilei (Italian: [ɡaliˈlɛːo ɡaliˈlɛi]; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642) was an Italian astronomer, physicist and engineer, sometimes described as a polymath, from Pisa.[3] Galileo has been called the "father of observational astronomy",[4] the "father of modern physics",[5][6] the "father of the scientific method",[7] and the "father of modern science".[8] Galileo studied speed and velocity, gravity and free fall, the principle of relativity, inertia, projectile motion and also worked in applied science and technology, describing the properties of pendulums and "hydrostatic balances". He invented the thermoscope and various military compasses, and used the telescope for scientific observations of celestial objects. His contributions to observational astronomy include telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, observation of the four largest satellites of Jupiter, observation of Saturn's rings, and analysis of sunspots. Galileo's championing of Copernican heliocentrism (Earth rotating daily and revolving around the sun) met with opposition from within the Catholic Church and from some astronomers. The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615, which concluded that heliocentrism was foolish, absurd, and heretical since it contradicted Holy Scripture.[9][10][11] Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems (1632), which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated both the Pope and the Jesuits, who had both supported Galileo up until this point.[9] He was tried by the Inquisition, found "vehemently suspect of heresy", and forced to recant. He spent the rest of his life under house arrest.[12][13] During this time, he wrote Two New Sciences (1638), primarily concerning kinematics and the strength of materials, summarizing work he had done around forty years earlier.

		<h2>Avengers Comic Book</h2>

		<p>The Avengers are a fictional team of superheroes appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team made its debut in The Avengers #1 (cover-dated Sept. 1963), created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist/co-plotter Jack Kirby. Labeled "Earth's Mightiest Heroes", the Avengers originally consisted of Iron Man, Ant Man, Hulk, Thor and Wasp. The original Captain America was discovered trapped in ice in issue #4, and joined the group after they revived him.

A rotating roster became a hallmark of the series, although one theme remained consistent: the Avengers fight "the foes no single superhero can withstand." The team, famous for its battle cry of "Avengers Assemble!", has featured humans, superhumans, mutants, Inhumans, deities, androids, aliens, legendary beings, and even former villains.

The Avengers have appeared in a wide variety of media outside of comic books, including several different animated television series and direct-to-video films. The Avengers also play a central role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) being the focus in multiple MCU feature films, beginning with the eponymous 2012 live-action film, The Avengers, and followed by the sequels Age of Ultron (2015), Infinity War (2018), and Endgame (2019), the latter two of which were based on The Infinity Gauntlet storyline. The Avengers also featured in Captain America: Civil War (2016), which drew loosely from the Civil War storyline. Individual members of the team also have standalone franchises, such as Iron Man, Thor, Captain America and Ant-Man.</p>

		<h1>My Favorite Movie:</h1>
		<i style="font-size: 25px; margin-left: 700px;">The Lion King</i>

		<img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0Wm6hmTgsHQ/hqdefault.jpg" alt="There was supposed to be an image here" width="700px" height="700px">
           <p>The Lion King is a 2019 American musical drama film directed and produced by Jon Favreau, written by Jeff Nathanson, and produced by Walt Disney Pictures. It is a photorealistic computer-animated remake of Disney's traditionally animated 1994 film of the same name. The film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alfre Woodard, Billy Eichner, John Kani, John Oliver, Florence Kasumba, Eric André, Keegan-Michael Key, JD McCrary, Shahadi Wright Joseph, and Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, as well as James Earl Jones reprising his role from the original film. The plot follows Simba, a young lion who must embrace his role as the rightful king of his native land following the murder of his father, Mufasa, at the hands of his uncle, Scar.

Plans for a remake of 1994's The Lion King were confirmed in September 2016 following box office successes for Disney remakes such as The Jungle Book (2016), which was also directed by Favreau. Favreau was inspired by certain roles of characters in the Broadway adaptation, and developed upon elements of the original film's story. Much of the main cast signed in early 2017, and principal photography began in mid-2017 on a blue screen stage in Los Angeles. The "virtual-reality tools" utilized in The Jungle Book's cinematography were used to a greater degree during filming of The Lion King. Composers Hans Zimmer, Elton John, and lyricist Tim Rice, all of whom worked on the original's soundtrack, returned to compose the score alongside Knowles-Carter, who assisted John in the reworking of the soundtrack and wrote a new song for the film, titled "Spirit", which she also performed. The film serves as the final credit for editor Mark Livolsi, and it is dedicated to his memory. With an estimated budget of around $260 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made.

The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 19, 2019. It has grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide during its theatrical run, overtaking Frozen to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time. It also became the seventh highest-grossing film of all time and the second highest-grossing film of 2019. The Lion King received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects, music, and vocal performances (particularly Rogen and Eichner), but criticism for its excessive similarity to the original film, and lack of originality and facial emotion on the characters.[6] The film received nominations for Best Animated Feature Film and Original Song categories at the 77th Golden Globe Awards[7] and 25th Critics' Choice Awards. It was also nominated at 73rd British Academy Film Awards and 92nd Academy Awards,[8] both for visual effects. A follow-up film is in development with Barry Jenkins attached to direct</p>
